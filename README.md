# Explore-a-Dataset-on-Energy-Usage-and-Draw-The-First-Conclusions

### Project Overview (Case Study)
AusEnergy has supplied us with some data regarding energy demand in Australia over a few years. They want us to show that we can interpret their existing data. To me, that means creating lots of clear tables and charts! 
The big concern this client has is that they need to manage the supply of energy efficiently. You can’t just flip a switch to turn on a power station! They can only manage supply if they know when demand is likely to go up and down. 
We need to help them answer three key questions, and the tables and charts I have in mind will allow us to do this:

- What does demand look like over time?
- What does extreme demand look like, and under what circumstances does this happen?
- How do factors like the weather and holidays affect demand?

### Data Source
- AusEnergy has provided a file called **energy_demand.csv** showing daily energy demand and price information from 2015-2020. It also includes details of the weather on each day.
- To analyse demand on holidays vs. non-holidays, so I’ve pulled together a spreadsheet showing which of these days are school days and which are public holidays. You can find this in **holidays.xlsx**.

### Tools

- Excel used for Cleanning, Prepare, Tranform and Analyse the data.

The project is composed of the following main tasks:
  1. Get all our data loaded and in shape.
  2. Create a neatly formatted version of the data.
  3. Show summaries of the demand over time.
  4. Show the effect of weather on demand.
  5. Show the impact of holidays on demand.
